# refugee_model
Refugee flow weighed and unweighted models

We have 2 notebooks for weigted and unweighted models

For successful run of the notebook put codes, "data" and "utils" folders in te same directory

IMPORTANT: 
The model codes is precessed by the hyperparamerer grid search part (cell 8 in both notebooks). 
If you want to skip that for time saving, you can use the values in commented out dictionary in cell 9 instead. That would be the parameters that we used as a result of grid search.
