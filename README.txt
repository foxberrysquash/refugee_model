We have 2 notebooks for weigted and unweighted models
For successful run of the notebook put codes, "data" and "utils" folders in te same directory
IMPORTANT: the model code is precessed by the hyperparamerer grid search part (cell 8 in both notebooks). If you want to skip that, in cell 9 ("#build best model") instead using the values of best_params dictionaries use commented out values. That would be the parameters that we used as a result of grid search.
